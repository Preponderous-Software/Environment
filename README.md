# Viron
This is a tool for creating and managing virtual environments and entities within those environments. This intended to be used for game development, but can be used for other purposes as well.

## What is a virtual environment?
A virtual environment is a space where entities can exist and interact with each other. This can be a 2D or 3D space, and can be as simple as a blank space or as complex as a fully realized world.

In Viron, a virtual environment is a 2D space where entities can exist and interact with each other. The environment is made up of a grid of cells, each of which can contain a number of entities. The behavior of the entities is up to the client application, which can define rules for how entities interact with each other and with the environment.
